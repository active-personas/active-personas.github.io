# Background

User participation and user feedback are essential to the suc￾cess of new product development (NPD). Development teams use user feedback to derive requirement engineering artifacts, such as user scenar￾ios, user stories, concept mindmaps, and user personas, to guide them in identifying and addressing a particular user problem. However, finding enough user participation to collect meaningful feedback is challenging, and less attention has been given to addressing this.


# Active Personas

**Active Personas** (**APs**), fictional users capable of generating contextual feedback through an interactive multi-modal interaction, such as text, voice, image, and video. APs enable development teams to gather feedback on their solutions through iterative internal experimentation. APs use generative artificial intelligence to enable dynamic multi-modal interaction and utilize user personas to generate contextual feedback.
