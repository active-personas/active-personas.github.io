# Background

User participation and user feedback are essential to the suc￾cess of new product development (NPD). Development teams use user feedback to derive requirement engineering artifacts, such as user scenarios, user stories, concept mindmaps, and user personas, to guide them in identifying and addressing a particular user problem. However, finding enough user participation to collect meaningful feedback is challenging, and less attention has been given to addressing this.



# Active Personas

**Active Personas** (**APs**), fictional users capable of generating contextual feedback through an interactive multi-modal interaction, such as text, voice, image, and video. APs enable development teams to gather feedback on their solutions through iterative internal experimentation. APs use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to enable dynamic multi-modal interaction and utilize user personas to generate contextual feedback.

## User Personas

User personas are *"hypothetical archetypes of actual users"* developed iteratively through user research. It provides a descriptive model of real users to com￾plement human participation in NPD. This concept is often used in RE activities, solution design, and usability testing. For example, capturing user needs and designing user interfaces. A user persona commonly consists of user goals, motivations, pain points, personal characteristics, skills, experiences, environmental, and group characteristics that reflect the actual users. A development team can also use their assumption about the target users as a basis to create initial personas, i.e., proto-personas. User personas help the development team build empathy towards their users and understand the problems from the users’ perspective.

## GenAI

As a subset of AI technology, GenAI can create novel human-like generated content in various modalities, including texts, images, audio, videos, and simulations. This technology lever￾ages advanced machine learning models to recognize patterns and relationships within a large dataset to generate responses to given inputs. Approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, can feed user per￾sonas and other RE artifacts into GenAI.


# Our Plan

1. Develop an initial prototype of APs
2. Studies in controlled settings, e.g., open-source projects
3. Studies in ongoing projects in various types and domains
4. Evaluate the alignment between the internal & external experimentation.
